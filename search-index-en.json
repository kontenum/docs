[{"id":0,"title":"Cache Purge","content":"Home Cache Purge Cache Purge The Purge feature allows you to remove cached content from the Kontenum CDN so that the next request will fetch fresh content directly from your origin. Purge is useful when you: Update files (CSS, JS, images, media) Deploy a new version of your application Need to immediately invalidate outdated or incorrect content --- How Purge Works When a URL is purged: 1. Kontenum removes the cached object from all edge locations 2. The next client request triggers a new fetch from origin 3. The refreshed content is cached again based on your caching rules Purge operations are safe and do not affect your origin data. --- How to Trigger a Purge 1. Purge via Console (Web UI) You can manually submit a purge request through the Kontenum Console . This is the fastest way to purge individual URLs during development or small updates. 2. Purge via API For automation and CI/CD workflows, purge can also be triggered using the Kontenum API . Using the API allows you to: Purge content during deployments Integrate purge into build pipelines Bulk purge programmatically --- Purge Form Fields URL (Required) The URL field specifies which cached content should be removed. Example: Automatic Wildcard Purge Kontenum automatically applies wildcard purging based on the URL you provide. Example: This will purge: All cached files under the path will be removed. > ⚠️ Be careful when purging high-level paths, as this may invalidate a large number of cached objects. --- Origin Header (Optional) The Origin Header field allows you to purge cached content selectively based on the origin domain used when fetching assets. This value is sent as the HTTP Origin header when the CDN performs cache validation. Example: When to Use Origin Header Use this field when: Multiple domains share the same CDN delivery domain You want to purge content fetched from a specific origin only You are hosting multi-tenant or multi-origin configurations If left empty, the purge applies to all origins associated with the URL. --- Best Practices Purge specific paths or files instead of full domains whenever possible Use API-based purge for automated deployments Avoid frequent full-path purges on high-traffic sites Combine purge with proper cache-control headers for optimal performance --- Common Use Cases | Scenario | Recommended Action | | -------------------- | ---------------------------- | | Update a single file | Purge exact file URL | | Update a folder | Purge folder path (wildcard) | | Multi-origin setup | Use Origin Header | | CI/CD deployment | Use Purge API | --- Notes Purge affects cached content only, not origin storage Newly fetched content will respect your site caching rules Purge requests are processed globally across all CDN edge locations --- If you need help with advanced purge scenarios or API usage, refer to the API documentation or contact support team .","url":"/en/docs/cache-purge/"},{"id":1,"title":"Advanced Configuration","content":"Home Configuration Advanced Configuration This guide will help you configure advanced settings for your Kontenum CDN site. This page explains Advanced Configuration options available when editing a Site in Kontenum CDN. These settings allow you to fine‑tune delivery behavior, security, performance, and access control for your CDN site. > ⚠️ Important: Changes may take a few minutes to propagate across the CDN network. --- General Settings Site Name A human‑readable identifier for your site. Used only inside the console Does not affect traffic or DNS --- CNAME Target This is the system‑generated CDN endpoint for your site. Example: You must configure your Delivery Domain to point to this value using a CNAME record. --- Added On / Last Modified Informational timestamps showing when the site was created and last updated. --- Delivery Settings Delivery Domain The public domain used by your end users. Example: Notes: If left empty, Kontenum will automatically assign a default CDN domain Must be a domain you own and can manage via DNS --- Custom Response Headers Add custom HTTP headers to responses sent to users. Format: Example: --- Header Override Behavior For certain standard headers, Kontenum will override the value returned by your origin if the same header is defined as a custom response header. This behavior prevents duplicated or conflicting headers in the final response. The following headers are subject to override: - - - - - - If any of the headers above are configured in Custom Response Headers, the value set here will take precedence over the value sent by your origin server. --- Automatic HTTPS Protection (Let’s Encrypt) Enable free SSL certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt. How it works: 1. Point your Delivery Domain to the CNAME Target 2. Enable this option 3. Kontenum automatically issues and renews certificates ✔ Certificates auto‑renew before expiration Learn more about SSL Setup. --- Origin Settings Origin Type Defines where content is fetched from. Domain – External server or website Storage – Kontenum Object Storage --- Origin The hostname of your origin server. Example: --- Origin Path (Optional) Restrict CDN delivery to a specific sub‑path. Example: --- Origin Protocol Protocol used by CDN to connect to your origin. HTTPS (recommended) HTTP Ensure this matches your origin configuration. --- Request Headers to Origin Custom headers added to requests sent from CDN to your origin. Example: --- Security Settings Geo Restriction Restrict access based on user location. Modes: Off By Country Code (ISO 3166‑1 alpha‑2) By Continent Code Example: --- IP Restriction Control access by IP address. Modes: Allow from list Deny from list Supports: Single IPs CIDR ranges Example: --- Referrer Restrictions Allow or deny requests based on the header. Examples: --- Secure Link (Signed URL Protection) Protect content using time‑limited, signed URLs. Components: Secure Link Key (secret) Hash name (default: ) Expiration timestamp Optional extra arguments Use cases: Private downloads Paid content Anti‑hotlinking > See the built‑in modal documentation for full command examples. --- Other Settings Ignore Query Strings in Cache Serve the same cached object regardless of URL query parameters. Useful for: Static assets Cache hit optimization --- Enforce HTTPS Automatically redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS. Recommended when SSL is enabled. --- Image Optimization Automatically serves modern image formats (WebP / AVIF) when supported by browsers. Disable if: You require original image formats Your application handles image negotiation manually --- Cache Configuration Kontenum respects standard HTTP cache headers returned by your origin server. This means you have full control over what content is cached and how long it remains cached at the CDN. - If your origin sends cache headers (such as or ), Kontenum will follow those instructions exactly. - If your origin does not send any cache headers (this does not include or ), Kontenum will still cache the content using a default cache duration of 30 days. This default behavior ensures good performance out of the box while still allowing you to fine-tune caching behavior through your origin configuration. --- Best Practices Enable HTTPS + Auto SSL for all public sites Restrict origins to HTTPS when possible Use Secure Links for private or paid content Avoid disabling cache by query strings unless necessary * Set appropriate cache headers at your origin for optimal CDN caching --- Need help with advanced configurations?

This feature is designed to automatically optimize and deliver images in the most efficient format supported by the end user's browser, improving performance and reducing bandwidth costs without sacrificing visual quality. Image optimization runs on the fly at the CDN level and requires no changes to your application or image upload workflow. --- How It Works When Image Optimization is enabled, Kontenum CDN automatically detects browser capabilities and serves the most optimal image format using the following priority order: 1. AVIF If the browser supports AVIF, Kontenum will automatically deliver the image in AVIF format. 2. WebP If AVIF is not supported but WebP is supported, the image will be delivered in WebP format. 3. Optimized Original Format If neither AVIF nor WebP is supported, Kontenum will serve an optimized version of the original image format (for example, optimized JPEG or PNG). This process is fully automatic and transparent to both developers and end users. --- Disabling Image Optimization You can disable Image Optimization at any time from Sites Configuration in the Kontenum Console. !Image Optimization Setting When enabled: Kontenum CDN serves optimized images (AVIF / WebP / optimized original). When disabled: Kontenum CDN serves the raw original file exactly as uploaded. This allows full control for debugging, testing, or specific compatibility requirements. --- Size Reduction Example Below is a real-world comparison using the same image at the same visual quality: Original JPEG !Original JPEG Resolution: 4032 × 2268 pixels File size: 4.6 MB Optimized Formats Delivered by Kontenum CDN (Avif) !Optimized AVIF Resolution: 4032 × 2268 pixels File size: 366 KB Optimized Results | Format | File Size | Size Reduction | | -------------- | --------- | ------------------ | | AVIF | 366 KB | ~92.0% smaller | | WebP | 568 KB | ~87.7% smaller | | Optimized JPEG | 963 KB | ~79.1% smaller | Benefits Lower bandwidth and storage costs Faster page load times Same visual quality with significantly smaller files Automatic browser compatibility handling * Zero configuration and zero additional cost By reducing average image size by up to 90%, Image Optimization directly improves CDN efficiency while delivering a faster experience for your users.","url":"/en/docs/features-image-optimization/"},{"id":3,"title":"Getting Started","content":"Home Getting Started Getting Started with Kontenum CDN This guide will help you get up and running quickly with Kontenum, from requesting access to deploying your first CDN site.

Once approved, we will create your account and provide access to the Console After your account is ready, you can immediately start creating CDN sites. --- Key Concept: What Is a Site? In Kontenum, a Site represents a CDN configuration similar to a CDN zone or distribution in other providers. A Site defines: Where your content originates from (Origin) Which domain your users will access (Delivery Domain) How traffic is fetched and delivered through Kontenum’s CDN Each Site is deployed independently and can be managed from the Sites section in the Console . --- Quick Start: Create Your First Site You can create your first CDN Site in just a few minutes. Navigate to: Console → Sites → Create New Site You will see a form similar to the screen below. !Create Site Form --- Site Configuration Fields 1. Site Name Give your site a descriptive name to easily identify it later. Example: --- 2. Origin Type Choose where your original content is hosted. Domain – Use an existing website or server as the origin Storage – Use Kontenum Storage as the origin (for static assets) For most first-time setups, choose Domain. --- 3. Origin Domain Enter the domain where your content is currently served from. Example: Kontenum will fetch content from this origin and cache it across our CDN network. --- 4. Origin Path (Optional) Specify a sub-path if only part of your origin should be served through the CDN. Example: Leave this empty to serve content from the root path. --- 5. Origin Protocol Select the protocol used to connect to your origin: HTTPS (recommended) HTTP Make sure this matches your origin server configuration. --- 6. Delivery Domain This is the domain your end users will access. Typically, this is a domain you own and control. Example: > ⚠️ Make sure you can configure DNS records for this domain. --- Deploy the Site Once all fields are filled: 1. Click Create Site 2. Deployment will start automatically 3. The process usually takes around 5 minutes After deployment completes, your first CDN Site is live 🎉 --- What’s Next?

Metrics are divided into two main pages: 1. Metrics Overview and 2. Metrics Details. --- Metrics Overview The Metrics Overview page gives you a high-level summary of your CDN usage for the selected month and region. !Metrics Overview What You Can See Sites – Total active CDN sites in your account Users – Number of users under the organization Certificates – Total SSL certificates uploaded or issued Monthly Summary Metrics The overview charts summarize usage across all sites: Bandwidth – Aggregate traffic served by the CDN Total Requests – Number of HTTP requests handled Cache Miss Ratio – Percentage of requests forwarded to origin HTTP Status Code Distribution – Breakdown of response codes (1xx–5xx) Cache Miss Ratio Threshold A reference line at 5% cache miss ratio is shown on the chart. A cache miss ratio below 5% is generally considered healthy and indicates effective caching Higher values may indicate dynamic content, missing cache headers, or frequent purges This threshold is provided as a guideline and may vary depending on your application behavior. --- Metrics Details The Metrics Details page provides in-depth insights for a selected month, metric type, and region. You can switch between: Bandwidth Requests Cache Miss Ratio HTTP Status Code Each view includes time-series charts and per-site breakdowns. --- Data Freshness & Processing Delay Metrics data is collected from all CDN edge locations and aggregated centrally. Near real-time data may change within the last 1 hour Metrics newer than 1 hour ago are considered running data and may be updated as additional edge reports are received Data older than 1 hour is considered finalized This ensures accuracy across all regions while still providing timely visibility. --- Bandwidth Metrics Bandwidth metrics show how much data is delivered by the CDN over time. !Bandwidth Metrics Units & Conversion All bandwidth-related metrics use base-10 (decimal) conversion: > ℹ️ This differs from Kontenum Storage metrics, which use base-2 (binary) conversion. Available Values Total – Total bandwidth consumed in the selected period Min – Minimum observed throughput 95/5 – 95th percentile value (used to understand sustained traffic) Max – Peak bandwidth --- Request Metrics Request metrics show how many HTTP requests are handled by the CDN. !Request Metrics Included Statistics Total Requests – Total number of requests Min Requests/sec – Lowest observed request rate Average Requests/sec – Average request rate Max Requests/sec – Peak request rate Top Sites A per-site breakdown shows which delivery domains generate the most traffic. --- Cache Miss Ratio Cache Miss Ratio represents the percentage of requests that must be forwarded to the origin server. !Cache Miss Ratio How to Interpret Low ratio → content is served efficiently from cache High ratio → frequent origin fetches The details view also includes: Request to Origin graph Per-site miss count and miss ratio This helps identify sites or paths that may benefit from improved caching rules. --- HTTP Status Code Metrics This view breaks down responses by HTTP status class: 1xx – Informational 2xx – Successful responses 3xx – Redirections 4xx – Client errors 5xx – Server errors !HTTP Status Code Metrics What to Look For A high percentage of 2xx responses indicates healthy traffic 4xx errors may indicate missing assets or invalid requests 5xx errors often point to origin issues A per-site table shows detailed status code distribution for each delivery domain. --- Best Practices Monitor cache miss ratio regularly and investigate sudden spikes Compare bandwidth and request trends to detect abnormal traffic Use per-site breakdowns to identify heavy or problematic domains Allow at least 1 hour before relying on metrics for incident analysis --- If you need raw metrics data, API access, or help interpreting unusual patterns, please contact support team .","url":"/en/docs/metrics/"},{"id":5,"title":"SSL & HTTPS Setup","content":"Home SSL & HTTPS Setup SSL & HTTPS Setup This guide explains how to secure your delivery domains on Kontenum CDN using SSL/TLS certificates. You can either upload your own certificate or enable automatic HTTPS using Let’s Encrypt (ACME). --- Overview Kontenum supports two ways to enable HTTPS: 1. Manual Certificate Upload Upload an existing SSL certificate issued by any trusted Certificate Authority. 2. Automatic HTTPS (ACME / Let’s Encrypt) Let Kontenum automatically issue and renew certificates for your delivery domain. Both methods result in certificates being managed centrally under Certificate Management. --- Uploading an SSL Certificate (Manual) Navigate to: Certificates → Certificate Management → Upload Certificate !Upload Certificate Form Required Fields You will see three input fields: Certificate (required) The public certificate file (usually or ). Private Key (required) The private key that matches the certificate. CA Bundle (optional but strongly recommended) The intermediate certificate chain provided by your Certificate Authority. Why CA Bundle Is Important Although Kontenum automatically validates certificates against public root CAs, uploading the full CA bundle is highly recommended because: Some operating systems or browsers may have missing or outdated root CAs Incomplete chains may cause browsers to show “Not Secure” warnings Enterprise environments often rely on explicit intermediate chains > Best practice: Always upload the full certificate chain (certificate + intermediates). After uploading, click Upload. The certificate will appear in the certificate list. --- Certificate Management & Status !Certificate Management After uploading (or selecting an existing certificate), you will see detailed certificate information: Common Name (CN) Subject Alternative Names (SANs) Issuer (e.g. Let’s Encrypt) Expiration date Trust status (validated against public CAs) Fingerprint You can also: Assign the certificate to one or more hostnames Mark a certificate as Default for eligible domains Replace or re-upload certificates before expiration --- Certificate Expiration Reminder Kontenum automatically monitors certificate expiration and sends reminder emails at: 30 days before expiration 14 days before expiration 7 days before expiration 1 day before expiration These notifications are sent to the account email to help you avoid service disruption. --- Automatic HTTPS (ACME / Let’s Encrypt) Kontenum provides built-in ACME support using Let’s Encrypt for free SSL certificates. How to Enable In your Site settings, enable: Automatic HTTPS Protection → Free SSL Certificate from Let’s Encrypt !Enable ACME The system will automatically go through these steps: 1. Create a new ACME order 2. Domain validation 3. Generate CSR 4. Certificate becomes active --- ACME Validation Requirements ACME uses HTTP-01 challenge, which has the following requirements: ✅ Delivery domain must NOT be a wildcard domain ✅ Delivery domain must already be active ✅ DNS must be configured correctly DNS Requirement Before enabling ACME, make sure: Your delivery domain has a CNAME record pointing to your Kontenum Site CNAME The domain is publicly reachable via HTTP !Site CNAME If DNS is not ready, validation will fail and the certificate cannot be issued. --- Automatic Renewal For Sites with ACME enabled: Certificates are automatically renewed 7 days before expiration Renewal notifications are sent: When renewal starts After renewal completes successfully No manual action is required as long as DNS and site configuration remain valid. --- ACME Certificates in Certificate List All certificates issued via ACME: Appear in the Certificate Management list Are treated the same as manually uploaded certificates Can be viewed, assigned, or replaced like any other certificate This ensures consistent management across all SSL methods. --- Best Practices Use ACME for simplicity and automatic renewal whenever possible Upload full CA bundles for manually managed certificates Monitor expiration emails and renew early if managing certificates manually * Avoid wildcard delivery domains if you want automatic HTTPS --- If you encounter validation or trust issues, verify DNS configuration and certificate chain completeness before contacting support.","url":"/en/docs/ssl-https-setup/"},{"id":6,"title":"Storage API","content":"Home Storage API Kontenum Storage API Overview Kontenum's object storage service is built to be 100% bit-compatible with AWS S3. This means any existing AWS S3-compatible application, SDK, or gateway device will work seamlessly with Kontenum. In some cases, Kontenum provides additional functionality or implements certain behaviors differently from AWS S3. This document highlights those differences and explains how to use the Kontenum S3 API effectively. Because of this compatibility, AWS S3 documentation should be treated as a complementary reference when working with Kontenum. --- Reference Specifications The AWS S3 capabilities referenced in this guide are based on: API Version: 2006-03-01 AWS Reference: Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference Throughout this guide: \"Kontenum\" refers to Kontenum S3 functionality \"AWS S3\" refers to the original AWS S3 API behavior --- API Limitations Please note that Kontenum S3 API has certain limitations compared to AWS S3. These are intentional design choices aligned with Kontenum's CDN‑origin use case. --- Access Keys and Authentication Generating Access Keys You can generate, view, rotate, and delete access keys through the Kontenum Console → Storage Access Keys section. > 📌 Note: Each account can have a maximum of two active access keys at any given time. !Storage Access Keys > Tips: > Store your Secret Access Key securely, as it is only shown once during key creation. > Rotate keys regularly for enhanced security. > Delete unused keys to minimize security risks. > If you want to rotate your keys, you should first create a new key, update your applications to use the new key, set old key inactive, monitor your applications, and then delete the old key. --- Authentication Method All API requests are authenticated via the Authorization HTTP header. Format: Both the Access Key and Secret Key are required to sign requests. --- Security Best Practices Never share your Secret Access Key with anyone Rotate access keys regularly Store keys securely in server-side configuration Do not embed keys in browser-side JavaScript or other untrusted environments --- Protocol Support Kontenum S3 supports: HTTP HTTPS (recommended for production environments) Choose the protocol that best fits your security and performance requirements. --- Access Control Behavior Read Access Restriction (READ access) is disabled via the S3 API. This is by design, as Kontenum Storage is optimized for CDN origin use cases. You can still: Download objects using the Storage Explorer feature in the Kontenum Console --- Host Designation Kontenum supports both AWS S3 request styles: Path-style requests Virtual-hosted–style requests Example host: Recommended Style Kontenum recommends path-style requests for maximum flexibility: Path-style avoids domain and certificate limitations related to bucket naming. --- Error Responses Wherever possible, Kontenum returns identical error responses to AWS S3, ensuring compatibility with existing AWS S3 tooling and SDKs. --- Request Signing and Authentication Kontenum supports the same request signing mechanisms as AWS S3: Supported Signature Versions Signature Version 2 Signature Version 4 Both header-based and query-parameter–based signing are supported. --- Signature Version 4 Offers stronger security Requires SHA256 hashing Slightly higher compute cost All regions are supported Default AWS region: Recommended for security-sensitive workloads. --- Signature Version 2 Faster signing and verification Suitable for performance-critical applications Data integrity can be verified using the returned ETag (MD5 hash) Additional Subresource Parameters Kontenum extends Signature Version 2 with additional query subresources: These parameters apply to: When using Signature Version 2, these subresources must be included in the signing calculation. --- Unsupported Operations Kontenum does not support: Browser-based uploads HTML form–based S3 uploads These operations are intended for web page workflows, which are not currently supported by Kontenum. --- Summary Kontenum S3 is fully compatible with AWS S3 while being optimized for CDN-origin workloads. Existing AWS S3 applications can be used with minimal or no changes, while keeping in mind Kontenum's specific access restrictions and signing behaviors.

It is designed to feel familiar to users coming from Amazon S3 consoles while remaining tightly integrated with Kontenum CDN. Overview Using Storage Explorer, you can: Browse objects and folders (prefixes) in your storage bucket Upload files directly from your browser Create folders Download objects Delete files or folders View operation results and upload status in real time --- Object Management Capabilities Using Storage Explorer, you can: Browse folders and objects Upload new objects Download existing objects Delete objects (soft delete, subject to retention policy) View object metadata such as: Object size Last modified timestamp Storage path / key name > ⚠️ Deleted objects are retained for 90 days and still contribute to storage usage during the retention period. --- Versioning Behavior Object versioning is disabled by default. When versioning is not enabled: Uploading a file with the same key overwrites the existing object. If versioning is enabled (by request): Multiple versions of the same object key will be retained. All versions count toward active storage usage. --- Usage and Billing Visibility Storage Explorer reflects logical object size, not prorated billing size. Billing calculations are handled separately based on: Active Storage Deleted Storage Daily usage accumulation across the month For detailed billing calculations, refer to the Storage Pricing and Usage documentation. --- File and Folder Navigation !Storage Explorer UI Objects are displayed in a folder-style hierarchy based on S3 prefixes. Breadcrumb navigation allows quick movement between folders. Folders are logical prefixes and may be represented as zero-byte objects ending with . --- Upload Files !Upload Files Supports drag-and-drop and manual file selection. Maximum upload size: 500 MB per file. Multiple files can be uploaded in parallel. Upload progress and results are displayed per file. Filenames are validated to prevent invalid characters and unsafe paths. --- Create Folders !Create Folders Folders can be created directly from the UI. Folder names are validated for S3 compatibility. Newly created folders can be accessed immediately. --- Delete Objects !Delete Objects Files and folders can be deleted individually or in bulk. Deleting a folder removes all objects under the selected prefix. A confirmation step is required before deletion. Deleted objects are subject to the 90-day deleted object retention policy. --- Action Log !Action Log Displays the result of upload and delete operations. Includes success and error messages for transparency. Useful for diagnosing partial failures during bulk operations. --- Security and Access Model Storage Explorer uses temporary presigned URLs for uploads and downloads. All operations follow the same behavior and permission model as Amazon S3–compatible APIs. --- Best Practices Avoid frequent delete-and-reupload cycles to minimize deleted storage accumulation. Use consistent object naming conventions to prevent accidental overwrites.

This page gives a high‑level overview of how Kontenum Storage works, how it is billed, and when it is the right choice for your workload. --- What is Kontenum Storage? Kontenum Storage is an S3‑compatible object storage service tightly integrated with Kontenum CDN. Key characteristics: Storage is directly associated with your CDN Site (not standalone storage) Designed for origin storage in CDN workflows Compatible with Amazon S3 APIs, SDKs, and tooling If you have worked with Amazon S3 before, Kontenum Storage will feel familiar. --- Storage Activation By default, Storage is not enabled on new accounts. To start using Storage: 1. Navigate to the Storage section in the Kontenum Console 2. Review and accept the Storage & Pricing Agreement 3. Storage will be activated for your organization > ⚠️ Storage usage incurs cost once enabled. Make sure you understand the pricing model before activation. --- Bucket Model Kontenum uses a simplified bucket model: 1 bucket per organization account The bucket can serve multiple Sites within the same organization Bucket naming and access are managed automatically This approach reduces operational complexity while maintaining compatibility with S3‑based workflows. --- Storage Pricing & Minimum Commitment Kontenum applies a minimum storage commitment pricing model. Minimum Storage Commitment Minimum storage: 100 GB Price: Rp.200 / GB This means: If your usage is below 100 GB, you are billed for 100 GB If your usage is above 100 GB, you are billed for actual usage Pricing Examples Usage: 80 GB Cost: Usage: 100 GB Cost: Usage: 101 GB Cost: --- Storage Unit Calculation (Base‑2) Kontenum uses base‑2 (binary) conversion for storage measurement: 1 GB = 1,024 MB 1 MB = 1,024 KB 1 KB = 1,024 Bytes 1 GB = 1,073,741,824 Bytes This is consistent with how most object storage systems calculate actual storage usage. --- Monthly Usage Calculation Storage billing is calculated as the sum of Active Storage and Deleted Storage usage per month. How it works Storage usage is calculated daily Daily usage values are accumulated across the month Objects uploaded mid‑month are billed proportionally Example You upload an object on day 17 of a 30‑day month The object exists for 13 days in that month You are charged for 13 days worth of that object’s size --- Deleted Object Retention When objects are deleted: Deleted objects are retained for 90 days Deleted storage still counts toward monthly usage during the retention period > 💡 Recommendation: Avoid frequent deletion of objects. Kontenum Storage is optimized for long‑lived content rather than rapid create‑and‑delete patterns. --- Object Versioning Versioning is disabled by default Versioning can be enabled by request If you require: Object recovery Protection against accidental overwrites Historical object versions Please contact Kontenum support to enable versioning. --- Compatibility with Amazon S3 Kontenum Storage is designed to be API‑compatible with Amazon S3, including: S3 REST API AWS SDKs Common S3 tools and libraries This allows you to: Reuse existing applications Migrate workloads with minimal changes Integrate easily with CI/CD and backup workflows --- Cost Comparison with AWS S3 Minimum Storage Retention Impact Unlike AWS S3 Standard, Kontenum applies a minimum storage commitment. Some AWS storage classes (such as Glacier) have similar retention models, but S3 Standard does not. Cost Behavior Example (100 TB) If 100 TB is stored for less than 23 days: AWS S3 may be cheaper Kontenum may be more expensive If 100 TB is stored for more than 23 days: Kontenum becomes more cost‑effective Long‑Term Cost Advantage After 1 year, AWS S3 Standard can be ~4× more expensive than Kontenum This does not include additional AWS charges such as: Egress bandwidth API requests Summary Short‑lived data ( 23 days) → Kontenum is typically more cost‑effective Kontenum Storage is optimized for CDN origin storage, static assets, and long‑term content delivery use cases. --- Next Steps Configure S3 access keys * Understand Storage Utilization","url":"/en/docs/storage-overview/"},{"id":9,"title":"Storage Utilization","content":"Home Storage Utilization Storage Utilization The Storage Utilization page provides visibility into how much object storage your organization consumes over time. This view is used primarily for usage tracking and billing reference. !Storage Utilization --- Daily Calculation Model Storage metrics are calculated once per day, at the end of each day. Values shown represent a daily snapshot, not real-time usage. Changes made during the current day (uploads or deletions) will be reflected after the daily calculation completes. --- Storage Categories Storage utilization is broken down into the following components: Total Storage Represents the sum of Active Storage and Deleted Storage. This value is used as the basis for monthly storage billing. Active Storage Size of all currently existing objects in the bucket. Includes all live objects accessible via CDN or S3 API. Deleted Storage Size of objects that have been deleted but are still within the 90-day retention period. Deleted storage continues to count toward total storage usage until permanently expired. Total Objects Number of objects currently stored (active objects only). Deleted objects are not included in this count. --- Utilization Breakdown Chart The chart displays daily storage usage for the selected month: Total Storage – combined active and deleted storage Active Objects – live object storage size Deleted Objects – retained deleted object storage size Hovering over a specific date reveals the exact values recorded for that day. --- Monthly View Storage utilization is displayed per calendar month. You can switch months to review historical storage growth or deletion patterns. Early-month values may appear low if objects were uploaded later in the month. --- Unit Conversion (Base-2) All storage values use base-2 (binary) conversion, consistent with object storage standards: 1 GB = 1024 MB 1 MB = 1024 KB 1 KB = 1024 Bytes 1 GB = 1,073,741,824 Bytes This differs from bandwidth and traffic metrics, which use base-10 conversion. --- Billing Implications Daily storage values are accumulated to calculate monthly storage usage. Both Active Storage and Deleted Storage contribute to billing totals. Uploading objects late in the month results in partial-month billing, proportional to remaining days. --- Key Notes Storage utilization is not real-time. Deleted storage impacts cost until the retention period expires. * Use this page to monitor storage growth trends and deletion behavior over time.","url":"/en/docs/storage-utilization/"}]
